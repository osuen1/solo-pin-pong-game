# solo-pin-pong-game
 A game pin-pong. Not worked out

So, this is my first github project, so I would really appreciate your comments on it. Please don't judge me harshly.
This project represents my first conscious steps in web programming, so it's not perfect. I just wanted to make an easy-to-write game that doesn't carry any semantic load. I hope I did it.

The game starts on localhost:3000 after running go run main.go to the terminal.
